# EncryptorLite
EncryptorLite is a powerful tool for encrypting and decrypting files using AES encryption. This tool ensures that your sensitive data remains secure and protected at all times.

## Installation
You can download the `encryptor_lite.py` file directly and run it using Python.

## Usage
The tool will first ask you if you want to encrypt or decrypt a file. You can choose the option by entering 'E' for encrypt and 'D' for decrypt.

Next, it will ask for the full path to the file that you want to encrypt/decrypt.

Lastly, you will need to provide a 16, 24, or 32 byte key for the encryption/decryption.

Please be aware that this tool will overwrite the original file with the encrypted/decrypted content.

## Dependencies
This script requires the PyCryptodome library. You can install it using pip:
```
pip install pycryptodome
```
